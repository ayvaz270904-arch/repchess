# Rep Chess Education — project guide

Chess school CRM. Three static apps + Telegram bot. Owner is admin; Russian UI, Russian replies to user.

## Deploy & files
- Push to `main` → Cloudflare auto-deploys: `https://repchess.ayvaz-270904.workers.dev/{index,trainer,client}.html`
- `index.html` — CRM admin (reads Google Sheets via GAS proxy)
- `trainer.html` — trainer/admin cabinet (Firebase Firestore + same GAS proxy for student base). ~4600 lines, single file.
- `client.html` — Telegram Mini App client cabinet (talks to bot GAS)
- `gas/` — **local-only mirrors** of the two Apps Script projects (crm-proxy.gs, bot.gs). NEVER commit (contains bot token; repo is public). User copies file content into script.google.com and redeploys: Deploy → Manage deployments → ✏️ → New version.
- Verify JS syntax after editing any html: `./check.sh` (no node on this Mac; parse-pass = OK, runtime errors like `console.error is not a function` are sandbox artifacts).

## Data flow & security
- Payments: Tilda → Table 1 → trigger → Table 2 (private) → CRM GAS `doGet` returns CSV (admin: all rows; trainer: only `assignedStudents`). Role check: idToken → accounts:lookup → uid; role read from Firestore `trainers/{uid}` **via ScriptApp.getOAuthToken()** (user-token REST path hit permanent quota 429 — do not go back to it).
- Firestore Security Rules are THE access boundary (not client-side isAdmin checks). Trainers cannot delete confirmed lessons (status done/cancelled/legacy-none) — rules + UI.
- Bot token lives only in GAS. Client data confidentiality is top priority; trainers must never get full student base access.

## Business rules (easy to break — see memory repchess-architecture)
- Paid = paymentid matches /tinkoff|sber|pay/i. Promo = `tinkoff:0`; certificates = `tinkoff:0-cert` + products `«Сертификат <код> — <Индив.|Групп.> <офлайн|онлайн>, N занятий»`.
- `identifyProduct()` is duplicated in index.html, trainer.html, gas/bot.gs — keep all three in sync.
- Balance: only status 'done' (or legacy no-status) burns lessons; FIFO against expired packs; 1 lesson=1mo, 4=3mo, 10=6mo validity.
- Cert promo codes: Firestore `certCodes/{code}` (REP-XXXX-XX, alphabet excludes 0O1ILX), redeemed by bot `action=redeemCert`.
- Group self-booking (bot `joinGroup`/`leaveGroup`): needs active group pack matching lesson format + total remaining > 0; cancel only before lesson day.
- Cabinet is open to EVERYONE (guest mode): unknown phone → link with empty email. Empty email must NEVER reach Firestore/sheet queries (matches technical rows) — every booking action guards `if (!link.email)`. Guest cert redemption mints `cert-<phone>@repchess.local`; doGet auto-upgrades guests via findClientByPhone every 10 min.

## Firestore quota discipline (Spark 50K reads/day; exhausted once — 2026-07-09)
- NEVER add unconditional `loadAdminData()/loadHomePage()/loadGroupLessons()` after user actions.
- Patch local caches instead: `_patchGroupCaches()`, `_homeIndivCache/_homeGrpCache`, `loadHomePage(true)` = render from cache (0 reads).
- `_enrichStudentsWithRemaining()` reads the whole lessons collection — guarded by 5-min memory + 10-min sessionStorage cache (`repchess_used_v1`); refresh button resets both.

## trainer.html structure (search by these anchors, don't trust line numbers)
- Tabs: Главная (home, actions only) / История (archive; trainer=view, admin=edit) / Групповые / График (per-slot format: `formats {0..6:{"16:00":"offline"|"online"}}`, no entry = both) / Финансы / Админ
- Key functions: `loadHomePage(fromCache)`, `lessonItemHTML`, `groupFeedItemHTML`, `histLessonItemHTML`, `openEditModal(id, viewMode)`, `openEditGroupModal(id, viewMode)`, `openAttendModal`, `submitAttendance`, `approveAttendance` (reads extras from form inputs `.extra-attend-inp` — admin edits them even after approve; re-matches vs full base, promotes found into studentEmails, syncs isExtraAttendee lessons: deleted rows → batch.delete, renamed → recreate), `generateCertCodes`, `submitAddStudent` (POST to GAS, no Content-Type header — avoids preflight), `_openModal/_closeModal` (scroll-lock, nested-safe), `getLessonFlags/getGroupFlags`.
- Modals are `.overlay` divs; delegated click handler near end of file (`data-edit-id`, `data-edit-group-id`).

## Working conventions (user's standing rules)
- ALWAYS give complete code for anything the user must paste elsewhere (GAS → edit `gas/*.gs` and tell user to copy the file; never partial snippets).
- ALWAYS ask when uncertain — user wants questions, not guesses.
- Edit html files directly, run `./check.sh`, commit with descriptive RU/EN message, push (auto-deploy). User verifies with Cmd+Shift+R.
- Keep responses in Russian.
